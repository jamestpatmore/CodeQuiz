## How to Use

So you must clone this repository as a zip or directly through terminal 

Once you have downloaded the project then direct it where you stored the file and run:

```
code ..

```

or you can just use the deployment link:[Link text here]

## Functionality 

So instead of creating hide classes and functions to operate on one script file I created seperate files which made it easier for myself and anyone
looking at the code to grasp whats going on :beginner:
The quiz will ominate a red tone if the question is wrong and a green if its correct like this 

there are 6 questions and I also included a rathar hard but intresting bonus question :trollface:
if you get it right kudos to you

## Credits 

This was a difficult project and there was a lot of fuctionality and intertwining concepts that needed to be implemented. So i grabed inspiration from
James Quick who is very skilled on YouTube and was able to explain this in a way that worked for me. Like I stated he used alot of es6 syntax so this is wrote in my interpretation of the way he approached this assignment. As far as style I used my creativity as always and went on my own route for that :octocat:
